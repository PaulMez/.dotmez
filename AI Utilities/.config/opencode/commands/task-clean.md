You are a task archiver for this project/git repo. When invoked with $ARGUMENTS, you will:

1. **Check for AI-Task.yml** in the repo root using Read. If it does not exist, stop and say: "No AI-Task.yml found. Nothing to clean."

2. **Read AI-Task.yml** and identify all tasks with `status: done` or `status: cancelled`. Recurring tasks (`recurring: true`) cycle back to `ready` when `/task-do` completes them, so they normally never reach `done` — if one is found with `status: done` anyway, archive it like any other. A recurring task at `status: cancelled` (manually retired by the user) is archived normally too.

3. **Print a preview** of what will be archived:
   ```
   Tasks to archive:
     task-02  [done]      Revamp add-website flow
     task-03  [done]      Label sample D3 charts
     task-05  [cancelled] Some cancelled task
   
   Tasks remaining in AI-Task.yml: 3
   ```
   If no done/cancelled tasks exist, print "Nothing to archive — AI-Task.yml is already clean." and stop.

   If `--dry-run` is in $ARGUMENTS, stop here and make no changes.

4. **Read or create Completed-AI-Task.yml** in the repo root:
   - If it already exists, read it to get the existing completed tasks list.
   - If it does not exist, treat it as having an empty `completed_tasks: []` list.

5. **Append the archived tasks** to `Completed-AI-Task.yml` under the `completed_tasks` key, adding an `archived_date` field (today's date, YYYY-MM-DD via `date +%Y-%m-%d`) to each task. Preserve all existing entries already in the file.

   Format:
   ```yaml
   completed_tasks:
     - id: task-02
       name: Revamp add-website flow
       description: "..."
       status: done
       size: medium
       priority: low
       dependencies: []
       created_date: 2026-05-31
       archived_date: 2026-06-09
   ```

   If the task has `recurring: true` and/or `last_run_date` set, preserve those fields in the archived entry too.

6. **Remove the archived tasks from AI-Task.yml** — rewrite the file keeping only tasks whose status is NOT `done` or `cancelled`. Preserve all other fields exactly as-is for remaining tasks.

7. **Print a completion summary**:
   ```
   Archived 5 task(s) → Completed-AI-Task.yml
   AI-Task.yml now has 3 active task(s)
   ```

## Rules
- Never archive tasks with status `ready`, `in-progress`, or `blocked` — only `done` and `cancelled`
- A recurring task sitting at `ready` (waiting for its next cycle) is never archived — only archive it if its status is explicitly `cancelled` (or, unusually, `done`)
- Never delete Completed-AI-Task.yml or overwrite existing entries in it — only append
- If `--dry-run` is passed, make zero file changes — only describe what would happen
- Always read before writing — never overwrite a file without reading it first
- Write valid YAML — quote strings containing colons or special characters
